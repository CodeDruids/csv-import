CSV-Import
================

CSV Import is a Codeigniter spark which makes it easy to import a CSV file into an associative array.


Usage
-----

First you must load the csv_import spark:

	$this->load->spark('csv_import/0.0.1')
	
To import a file, simply run the following command:
	
	$this->csvimport->get_array('test.csv');

It is important to note that this library treats the first row of a CSV file as a column header row.

If you would like to use a different set of column headers, other than what is generated by the file, you submit them as an array. *Warning* The function assumes that the number of column headers will match the number of values in each row.

	$this->csvimport->get_array('test.csv', array('id', 'name', 'company', 'phone'));
